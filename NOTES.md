The digital source was taken from the OUTOFWESTPAPUA database by [Kamholz et al. (2024)](https://database.outofpapua.com). For the CLDF conversion, the data was extended by new links to Glottolog, by adding a new orthography profile, and by providing consistent links of the concept list to [Concepticon](https://concepticon.clld.org). Links to the database are given in the column `Digital_Source` in the CLDF FormTable (`forms.csv`).
